# Spam Detection with Naive Bayes

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the detection of spam messages using the Naive Bayes algorithm. By employing statistical techniques and natural language processing (NLP), we build and evaluate a model capable of classifying text data as spam or not spam.

## Dependencies

- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

## Dataset

The project uses a collection of labeled emails, with a binary classification of 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'.

## Methodology

The process of creating the spam detection model includes:

- Vectorizing the text data using `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into numerical data that can be used by the machine learning algorithm.
- Training a `MultinomialNB` classifier on the processed data.
- Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Model Training

A simple yet effective Naive Bayes classifier is trained with the following steps:

```python
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_text)
```

## Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated to determine its effectiveness at spam detection. The performance is quantified using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Results

The results section should provide an overview of the model's classification abilities and potential areas for improvement.

## Repository Contents

- `SpamDetection.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step process for training the spam detection model and evaluating its performance.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebook to view the code and analysis. Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed on your machine.

## Conclusion

The Spam Detection with Naive Bayes project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in text classification. The model can be further refined and potentially integrated into email clients to help filter out unwanted messages.
